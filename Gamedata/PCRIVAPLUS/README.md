Probe Control Room IVA NASA retro style variant

- Installation : 
Merge the zip's GameData folder with your KSP/GameData folder.

- Dependencies :
Module Manager
Probe Control Room
ASET Consolidated Props and Avionics
RasterPropMonitor

Optional and recommended :
MirageProps (WIP) :	adds props to allow maneuver creation from IVA
NearfutureProps: 	adds decorative elemetents
TDProps : 			A few more decorative elements		

- Known issues :
ASET FDAI GUID MOD (navball vector selector) has sometime the animation not showing ingame, but the prop still works. Save/reload can fix.
ASET ARRT (alt/alt rate tape meter) doesn't work consistently. Save/reload can fix.
Random textures glitches : see :https://github.com/JonnyOThan/RasterPropMonitor/issues/112
	Fix for now : rename the extension or delete PropBatching.cfg, in Gamedata/JSI/RasterPropMonitor/
	Be aware, this could worsen the performances.
